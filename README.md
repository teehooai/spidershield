# TeeShield -- Security Scanner for MCP tools

**`npm audit` for MCP tools.** Scan tool definitions and detect unsafe descriptions before AI agents misuse them.

## Why TeeShield?

We scanned **79 MCP tools across 7 public servers** and found:

- Average description quality: **3.1 / 10**
- 0% of tools have "Use when..." scenario triggers
- 0% have parameter examples
- Fewer than 5% have error handling guidance

AI agents pick which tool to call based on the description text. A vague description like *"access filesystem"* gives the agent no boundaries -- it doesn't know which directories are safe, whether it should read or write, or what happens on failure.

TeeShield scans tool descriptions, scores them, and rewrites them automatically.

## Install

```bash
pip install teeshield
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Quickstart

```bash
teeshield scan ./your-mcp-server
```

Example output:

## Rewrite tool descriptions

TeeShield can automatically rewrite tool descriptions to be action-oriented, with scenario triggers, parameter examples, and error guidance.

```bash
# Preview changes (no files modified)
teeshield rewrite ./your-mcp-server --dry-run

# Apply changes to source files
teeshield rewrite ./your-mcp-server
```

Before (score 2.9):
```
"Shows the working tree status"
```

After (score 9.6):
```
"Query the current state of the Git working directory and staging area.
 Use when the user wants to check which files are modified, staged, or
 untracked before committing."
```

The rewriter works offline using templates (zero cost). Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for higher-quality LLM-powered rewrites.

```

## What TeeShield checks

**Descriptions** (weighted 40%)
- Scenario triggers ("Use when the user wants to...")
- Parameter examples
- Error handling guidance
- Disambiguation between similar tools
- Length (too short = vague, too long = noisy)

**Security** (weighted 30%)
- Path traversal
- Command injection
- SQL injection
- SSRF (unrestricted network access)
- Credential exposure

**Architecture** (weighted 20%)
- Test coverage
- Error handling
- Type annotations
- Input validation patterns

**License** (weighted 10%)
- MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD = OK
- GPL, AGPL = warning
- Missing = fail

## Rating scale

| Rating | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A+ | 9.0+ | Production-ready |
| A | 8.0+ | Safe with minor suggestions |
| B | 6.0+ | Usable, needs improvements |
| C | 4.0+ | Significant issues |
| F | <4.0 | Unsafe, do not deploy |
